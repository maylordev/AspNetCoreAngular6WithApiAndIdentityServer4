		"description": "Music TV for the internet age.\n\nBoiler Room televises underground music as it happens from around the world to a massive online community. By doing so, we create windows into scenes and sounds from every corner of the globe, connecting millions of music heads with the specific music they love. This communal participation has redrawn the map for underground culture and proven that mass audiences now subscribe to alternative choice.\n\ufffc\nOur output comes via four Channels representing the musical worlds we broadcast from – 1) grime, UK garage & worldly club sounds; 2) house & techno beamed via Berlin and beyond; 3) rap, trap and soulful rhythms; and 4) live bands through to the distinctly weird and wonderful. Our hosts present shows, curate playlists and publish newsletters keeping you in the loop with what’s happening from across those scenes every week. \n\nLean back & get comfy, music TV 2.0 is here.",
